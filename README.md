### What is Payit?

The idea for __Payit__ occurred to me when I missed a payment on one of my credit cards (oops). Basically, I wanted an application that would notify me a day or two before my card was due, sure my credit cards already sent me e-mails but I would never read them or they would send me the reminder a week in advance, and who remembers that? 

So for the first month in this "software challenge" I decided to try and build an app that would allow me to customize these notifications and as an added bonus would try and give me a recommended payment amount (some wonky math with interest, blah, blah). All the while learning more and more Android development concepts as well as becoming a better designer (I'm pretty bad right now).

### Stuff being worked on currently
1. Getting actual notifications, without having to have the user explicitly change their security settings, thanks _NotificationListenerService_...
2. Finish work on the About page of the application.
3. Get better maths for calculating recommended payment amount
4. ~~Add some nicer animations~~ UI in general
